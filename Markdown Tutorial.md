## 1.1 Text Representation & Format

### 1.1.1 Basic Syntax for Text formatting

#### 1.1.1.1 Text Paragraphs
Text paragraphs are the most basic way of writing content. There is no special symbol needed, the text written is interpreted automatically as a paragraph.

#### 1.1.1.2 Headers
Headers can be created using the `#` symbol at the start of the line. upto 6 sizes can be used with number of `#` representing the size with 1 being largets to 6 being smallest.
Always put a space after the `#` symbols for markdown to interpret as a header text.

Examples:
`#` text size equivalent to h1
`##` text size equivalent to h2
...
`######` text size equivalent to h6

#### 1.1.1.3 Bold & Italic
Symbol `*` can be used for these formatting. Wrap the text inside the symbol at each end to apply the formatting.

for italics, single `*` is used,
for bold, double `**` is used

Examples:
I was *running* through the corn field, when he yelled, **Why did you do it?**

### 1.1.2 Basic syntax for Text grouping

#### 1.1.2.1 Ordered Lists
Ordered lists can be created by using numbers before each line. Sub-lists can also be created by adding an indentation.

Example:
1. Manchester United
2. Liverpool
   1. 2020
   2. 2021
      1. Premier League Runners Up

#### 1.1.2.2 Unorder Lists
Special symbols `*`, `+` and `-` are used before each line to format it as bullet lists. Indentations are again applicable for sub-lists however, bullet points are formatted to various bullet types

Example:
* Item 1
* Item 2
  - To be received
    - confirmation pending
      - escalated


You can also mix and match between ordered and unordered lists
* 2021
  1. Manchester City
  2. Manchester United
  3. Liverpool
* 2020
  1. Liverpool
  2. Manchester City
  3. Manchester United

### 1.1.3 Tables
Writing tables is bit complicated using pipe `|` and dashes `---` characters

|  Position  | Team  | Points |
|---|---|---|
|  1 | Manchester City  | 88 |
| 2 | Manchester United | 81 |
| 3 | Liverpool | 80 |

Code:
`|  Position  | Team  | Points |`
`|---|---|---|`
`|  1 | Manchester City  | 88 |`
`| 2 | Manchester United | 81 |`
`| 3 | Liverpool | 80 |`

As seen it is quite complex to manage all the spacing, hence better to use extensions for managin table contents.
